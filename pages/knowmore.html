    <h2>----------------------- DISCLAIMER ------------------------</h2>
    <p>
        This application is not sponsored nor official AWS code. It's just a demo. The code does not intend to be efficient, secure, nor represents the best practices for development. In some points this is intentional to support the upcoming workshops and bootcamps, where participants will be invited to discuss, refactor, fix, and improve it. Use it at your own risk. Don't use it in production without proper techical evaluation.
    </p>
    <h2>----------------------------------------------------------</h2>
    <p>AWS SpaceInvaders is based on the code provided by <a href="https://github.com/dwmkerr/spaceinvaders">Dave Kerr</a>,
        which we have integrated to AWS to provide the multi-player contest-based playing experience. The game was
        developed for the 2018 re:Invent Partner's chalk talk sessions. The idea is to discuss possible strategies for
        implementing <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/">serverless</a> architectures for this game, and for
        similar workloads.</p>
    <p>As it happens with all solution architectures, there are many different alternatives for the implementation depending on the particularities of your enviroment (adopted technologies, time-constraints, costs, culture, and more).</p>
    <p>Soon the code will be made publicly available, and you will be able to fork it and test your own ideas.</p>
    <p>We will prepare some workshops and bootcamps around the game, to discuss services like Cognito, API Gateway,
        Kinesis, DynamoDB, Lambda, S3, Athena, Glue, and many others that can help you use serverless strategies to
        extract the best from the cloud.</p>
    <p>
        Soon we will get in touch to the participants of the 2018 re:Invent Partner's Chalk Talks. If you, AWS partner
        or customer, need anything else related to this experience, ping me: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabianmartinssilva/">Fabian
            Da Silva,</a> AWS Partner Solutions Architect.
